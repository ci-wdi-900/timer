# Timer


### Our Mission

We'll be using `setTimeout` (note the spelling and case!)--a built-in function in most JavaScript environments--to make a timer application in the terminal. We'll use callbacks to pass functions and times to `setTimeout`, saying, essentially, "Call this function after this time has passed!"

When we're done, we'll have a timer application that can run in the background and ping us after our time's up. And it will handle multiple timers. Pretty cool for what will ultimately be a short bit of code!


### Setup

You've got one line of code in `main.js`. It's a `console.log`, but a special one: it should make your terminal beep! Pretty cool, huh? It provides a nice audible indication that a timer is going off, but it's up to you whether you want that!

If that's NOT pretty cool, either because you hate it or can't get it to work, you can comment the line out and never use it. If you do want to use it, copy and paste it to wherever you want to use a timer beep! 


### Steps

0. We have a commented-out line of code for Version 0. Uncomment it and run `node main.js`. You should get a little beep in your terminal. (If you don't, there's probably something in your terminal's settings.) It's not a bad idea for this beep to stay in, as feedback that the app is running, and as feedback when testing to make sure that your app is running. It could get annoying, for sure, but we recommend leaving it in for now!

  If you DO take it out, leave it commented out rather than deleting it. It's good to have audible feedback that your timer's working, so we'll re-use the line later.
